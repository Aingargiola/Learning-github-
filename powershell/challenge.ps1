# # Bob is at it again! This time, he wants this done in PowerShell!
#  He wants to ask user input to have choices of the following:
# # PLEASE NOTE: Try to write this yourself. 
# At least 60 to 70% before looking up answers! You got this!
# # User will have to choose from four options:
# # L option will display “File is being deleted”
#  and have a count down timer of xx seconds. It is your choice to display how many seconds to delete a file. Note: You are not actually going to delete a file. I want you to display the text “File is being deleted” followed by a timer that ticks down.) And when the timer ends, it should display another text stating “File has been deleted.”
# # 2.  A option will display “File will be displayed” 
# and you can leave it as it or after completion, you can customize this section for yourself! I left this for you!
# # 3.   R option will have a text “File protection 
# is in progress” and display a progress bar with percentage 
# number going up to 100% displayed. The progress bar should
#  also display “Protecting in progress”.
# # 4.   Q option will end the program.
