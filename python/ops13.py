# Create a Python script that performs the following:

# Prompt the user to type a string input as the variable for your destination URL.

# Prompt the user to select a HTTP Method of the following options:
# GET
# POST
# PUT
# DELETE
# HEAD
# PATCH
# OPTIONS
# Print to the screen the entire request your script is about to send. Ask the user to confirm before proceeding.

# Using the requests library, perform a GET request against your lab web server.

# For the given header, translate the codes into plain terms that print to the screen; for example, a 404 error should print Site not found to the terminal instead of 404.

# For the given URL, print response header information to the screen.
